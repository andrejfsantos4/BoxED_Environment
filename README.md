# BoxED_Environment
A clean version of the Unity project used to collect BoxED. 

It should be used only as a starting point for similar experiments or to visualize the objects used in BoxED since this Unity project does not have the tracking components needed to replicate the experiments. It only has the objects, floor, table, and gripper.

Created and tested with Unity Editor 2020.3.32f1.
